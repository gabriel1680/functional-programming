# Functional Programming Fundamentals

 - Functions are in the center of your designs.
 - Functions act as both algorithm and data.
 - Solving problems only by composing (combinig).
 - Functional Programming is language agnostic.
 - Design Functional solutions in any language that function is a first citizen.
 - Functional Programming is declarative (vs imperative).
 - Think Functional Programming as a chain of Transformatinos over input.
 - By limiting the power, we get more control and discipline.
 - Less time needed to reason about the code.
 - Less boilerplate code.
 - Less coding more happening.
 - Less time needed to write tests meaning more confidence.
 - More reusable code.
 - More beauty in code and design.
 - More Functional features are being added to existing languages.
